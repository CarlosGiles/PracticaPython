To change an element, use the name of the list followed

"""
removing an Item Using the pop() Method
The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
with that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of a
list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack
"""
popped_my_team=my_team.pop()
print("After the battle, Jedi Knight Anakin goes: "+str(my_team))
print("Lost knight: "+str(popped_my_team))
"""
We started by defning and printing the list motorcycles at u. At v we pop
a value from the list and store that value in the variable popped_motorcycle.
We print the list at w to show that a value has been removed from the list.
Then we print the popped value at x to prove that we still have access to
the value that was removed.

"""
when you want to delete an item from a list
and not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an
item as you remove it, use the pop() method.
"""
"""Sometimes you wonâ€™t know the position of the value you want to remove
from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you
can use the remove() method.
